#  Job Tracker — Django Web App

A fully responsive, dark-mode enabled job application tracker built with Django, HTMX, and TailwindCSS.  
Designed to help job seekers organize their application process using a clean, Kanban-style interface.

>  Built in under 48 hours to explore Django + HTMX after receiving an interview invite from Carbon Equity.

##  Tech Stack

- **Django** — full server-side rendered backend (views, forms, models)
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling, dark mode, responsive layout
- **HTMX + Alpine.js** — dynamic UI without a frontend framework or JS build step
- **PostgreSQL** — production-grade relational database
- **Render.com** — live deployment with CI/CD integration
- **Whitenoise** — static file handling for production

✅ Full CRUD functionality for job entries  
✅ Dark mode toggle (saved via `localStorage`)  
✅ Responsive mobile-first layout  
✅ Modular Django template structure

##  Future Features / Roadmap

These are features I’m actively planning or considering for future updates:

- [ ] **User Authentication** — allow users to register and securely manage their own job boards  
- [ ] **Drag & Drop Kanban** — enable intuitive reordering and column shifting with JS or HTMX extensions  
- [ ] **Job Notes & Logs** — add notes or timeline updates (e.g. sent follow-up, received feedback)  
- [ ] **Deadline Reminders** — notify users of upcoming deadlines for applications or interviews  
- [ ] **Custom Columns** — allow users to define their own application stages (e.g. Coding Challenge, Final Round)  
- [ ] **CSV Export** — export job data for backup or analysis  
- [ ] **Search & Filters** — search by title, company, or status  
- [ ] **Tagging System** — label jobs by industry, location, or job type  
- [ ] **Multi-user Collaboration** — share job boards with mentors or accountability partners
